I am running the following nnUNet: 2d
My trainer class is:  <class 'nnunet.training.network_training.nnUNetTrainerV2.nnUNetTrainerV2'>
For that I will be using the following configuration:
num_classes:  3
modalities:  {0: 'FLAIR', 1: 'T1w', 2: 't1gd', 3: 'T2w'}
use_mask_for_norm OrderedDict([(0, True), (1, True), (2, True), (3, True)])
keep_only_largest_region None
min_region_size_per_class None
min_size_per_class None
normalization_schemes OrderedDict([(0, 'nonCT'), (1, 'nonCT'), (2, 'nonCT'), (3, 'nonCT')])
stages...

stage:  0
{'batch_size': 106, 'num_pool_per_axis': [5, 5], 'patch_size': array([192, 160]), 'median_patient_size_in_voxels': array([138, 169, 138]), 'current_spacing': array([1., 1., 1.]), 'original_spacing': array([1., 1., 1.]), 'pool_op_kernel_sizes': [[2, 2], [2, 2], [2, 2], [2, 2], [2, 2]], 'conv_kernel_sizes': [[3, 3], [3, 3], [3, 3], [3, 3], [3, 3], [3, 3]], 'do_dummy_2D_data_aug': False}

I am using stage 0 from these plans
I am using batch dice + CE loss

I am using data from this folder:  /home/wsic-ml/dhaval/projects/nnUNet_preprocessed/Task502_BrainTumour/nnUNetData_plans_v2.1_2D

I am running the following nnUNet: 2d
My trainer class is:  <class 'nnunet.training.network_training.nnUNetTrainerV2_DP.nnUNetTrainerV2_DP'>
For that I will be using the following configuration:
num_classes:  3

use_mask_for_norm OrderedDict([(0, True), (1, True), (2, True), (3, True)])

I am running the following nnUNet: 2d
My trainer class is:  <class 'nnunet.training.network_training.nnUNetTrainerV2.nnUNetTrainerV2'>
For that I will be using the following configuration:
num_classes:  3
modalities:  {0: 'FLAIR', 1: 'T1w', 2: 't1gd', 3: 'T2w'}
use_mask_for_norm OrderedDict([(0, True), (1, True), (2, True), (3, True)])
keep_only_largest_region None
min_region_size_per_class None
min_size_per_class None
normalization_schemes OrderedDict([(0, 'nonCT'), (1, 'nonCT'), (2, 'nonCT'), (3, 'nonCT')])

I am using batch dice + CE loss
